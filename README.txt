INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

IMPERATIVE GUIDELINES:
 - Participant folder MUST NOT have any spaces in their names
 
MAC:
    1. You'll need to allow your mac to open apps from anywhere. Go into your preferences -> Security and Privacy -> Allow apps downloaded from -> Anywhere
        NOTE: If you don't see the option to select "Anywhere", then go to your terminal application (you can just hit âŒ˜ + Spacebar to go to spotlight 
        search and then type "terminal".) 
        and enter this command:
        
            sudo spctl --master-disable
        
        After running this command you should be able to select the "Anywhere" option in your System preferences

    2. Depending on which app you wish to run (stitch, reformat-sync, search) -> head to the MAC folder and go to the app's respective folder. From there you'll
       see a lot of random set up files, you're looking for the file simply named. The names will be: reformat_sync, search, and stitch. They are the LAST files 
       in their respective folders. 
WINDOWS: 
    1. Running these apps on a Windows machine is much more straightforward. Simply go to the folder titled: WINDOWS and locate the .exe for the app you wish to run.
    2. It will alert you that the app you're about to run is from an unkown source, simply click "more info" and then "run anyways".
