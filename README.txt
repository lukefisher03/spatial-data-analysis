MAC:
    1. You'll need to allow your mac to open apps from anywhere. Go into your preferences -> Security and Privacy -> Allow apps downloaded from -> Anywhere
        NOTE: If you don't see the option to select "Anywhere", then go to your terminal application (you can just hit âŒ˜ + Spacebar to go to spotlight search and then type "terminal".) 
        and enter this command:
        
            sudo spctl --master-disable
        
        After running this command you should be able to select the "Anywhere" option in your System preferences

    2. Inside of the folder downloaded from github, head to the App folder and select the file labeled: "reformat-sync"
        This is a Unix system file that will run inside your terminal and direct you through the prompts to sort the dataset.
